    <h1>Privacy Policy for EllieMD Content Creator</h1>

    <h2>Privacy Policy for EllieMD Content Creator</h2>
    <p>Last Updated: September 1, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how EllieMD Content Creator ("the GPT"), a custom application built on OpenAI's platform, collects, uses, stores, and protects user data. EllieMD Content Creator is designed to generate video scripts and automate spreadsheet tasks based on user inputs. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.</p>

    <h3>1. Data We Collect</h3>
    <p>We may collect the following types of data when you use EllieMD Content Creator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Inputs</strong>: Text prompts provided to generate video scripts or instructions for spreadsheet automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Files</strong>: Spreadsheet files or other data you upload to enable automation tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you interact with the GPT, such as session duration, processed by OpenAI’s platform for operational purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <p>Your data is used solely to provide the functionality of EllieMD Content Creator:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video Script Generation</strong>: User prompts are processed to create video scripts tailored to your requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Spreadsheet Automation</strong>: Uploaded files or data inputs are used to populate or manipulate spreadsheets as instructed.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Improvement</strong>: Usage data may be processed by OpenAI to improve platform performance, subject to OpenAI’s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>We do not share your data with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI Platform</strong>: All data entered into EllieMD Content Creator is processed by OpenAI’s servers, subject to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party APIs</strong>: If EllieMD Content Creator integrates with external services (e.g., Google Sheets API for spreadsheet tasks), data may be shared with those services. We will disclose any such integrations and their respective privacy policies in this document if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
    <p>Data is stored securely on OpenAI’s platform, which uses AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.</p>
    <p>User inputs and uploaded files are retained by OpenAI for up to 30 days for abuse monitoring unless you opt out of data retention via OpenAI’s settings (Settings > Data Controls > Disable “Improve the model for everyone”). We do not independently store your data outside of OpenAI’s platform.</p>

        <li><strong>Data Deletion</strong>: Contact OpenAI support to request deletion of your data, subject to their policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Access</strong>: You may request access to your data through OpenAI’s support channels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Security Measures</h3>
    <p>We rely on OpenAI’s robust security practices to protect your data, including encryption and access controls. We do not independently store or process your data outside of OpenAI’s platform. You are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), is not included in prompts or uploaded files.</p>

    <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>If EllieMD Content Creator uses third-party APIs (e.g., for spreadsheet automation), we will update this policy to include details about those services and their data practices. As of the last update, no third-party APIs are integrated.</p>
